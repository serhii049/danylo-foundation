      <h1>
        Welcome the Danylo Kurliak Foundation for the health, safety and
        wellbeing of the Ukrainian youth
      </h1>
      <p>Dear friends,</p>
      <p>
        The <a href="https://vikna.if.ua/news/category/if/2019/09/04/101783/view"
          >tragic event</a
        >
        that resulted in the loss of Danylo Kurliak two year ago in a summer
        camp of Ivano-Frankivsk, Ukraine, was deeply painful for us and made us
        reflect on the priorities of our society and how we envision the future
        of our young people.
      </p>
      <p>
        The current economic situation in Ukraine makes it difficult to achieve
        the safety standards for installations of other European nations. This
        gap is even more visible if we compare the disparity of working
        opportunities young people have just by crossing borders.
      </p>
      <div>
        With this in mind, we decided to work towards making a small dent in
        society and help young people improve the safety of their everyday
        environment and give them tools for the future.
      </div>
      <div>
        My previous experience leading emergency response efforts in the oil and
        gas industry puts me in a good spot to kickstart an effort in health and
        safety systems. As a technologist, I like to think that technology will
        shape the world for the better. Talent is available in every country and
        nowadays an internet connection can be used to reduce inequalities
        between countries, creating a level playing field for all who can
        connect.

      <p><strong>Argentinian - Ukrainian organization</strong></p>
      <div>
        After several months of work, I am very pleased to announce the creation
        of the Danylo Foundation for the health, safety and wellbeing of the
        Ukrainian youth. We are a small team of highly motivated volunteers from
        Argentina and Ukraine willing to make an impact.
      </div>
      <p>
        The Argentinian branch of the foundation is commiting to USD $30,000
        from our own savings (UAH 800,000 approximately at the time of writing)
        for its first two years of existence to bootstrap the organization and
        finance a pilot program to teach technology skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        The funds will be initially managed by its founding members: Marcelo and
        Khrystyna Ruiz de Olano, and will be later transferred to a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization)">
          DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)
        </a>
        managed and controlled transparently by its members. Anyone willing to
        collaborate with their time or funds will be a member and will be able
        to influence the decisions for its direction through on-chain voting.
      </p>
      <div><strong>Our call to action</strong></div>
      <div>
        The first effort of the project will focus on establishing ties with
        youth institutions like schools, summer camps and sports clubs. We will
        fund and install safety equipment and train the staff in health and
        safety procedures in Burshtyn and Lviv. Our goal is to expand to the
        rest of Western Ukraine and eventually the whole country.
      </div>
      <p>
        The second effort will be focused on developing skills that will further
        increase the opportunities of the youth to be part of the future global
        workforce. We will select a small group, 5 to 7 people, of motivated
        individuals with high potential from the institutions we are working
        with and develop a 3 years programming and English bootcamp that will
        teach them technology skills that will allow them to insert in the
        global labor market.
      </p>
      <p>I hope I succeeded in sparking your interest in our mission.</p>
      <p>
